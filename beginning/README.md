# Digital Cookbook

Welcome to your new digital cookbook. Armed with an exhaustive list of recipes, this application will help you plan your meals more efficiently. If you like to cook but spend too much time picking out what to cook, this application will allow you to filter through dfferent aspects of recipes and help you schedule what you'll cook for the next day, week, montgh (that part is up to you).

## Home
The home page shows all recipes that you haven't marked as "not a reorder" (discussed later). You can search through the recipe names, ingredients, source and interest columns to narrow them down. You can filter by the tags for further efficiency in site navigation.

## Add a recipe
If you come across a recipe that isn't on the list but you either want to try or you love and want to make sure you can remember it, have no fear. Either click on the navbar link or the button on the home page and you can add a new recipe. Make sure to add as many datapoints as applicable to allow yourself easy recall in the future.

## Not A Reorder
If you ever cook a recipe that you decide just isn't your taste, you can click the x and mark that this recipe is not a reorder for you. It will remove it from the initial list and move it to the "not a reorder" list that you can navigate to in the navbar. Why not just compete the recipe from the directory completely? Sometimes you maycome across a recipe and you'll forget if you cooked it already. This will let you make sure you won't cook it again.
